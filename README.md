A small plug-in replacement for a Nano without all the extra components has got to save power, right?  
<br>  
And whilst we're at it, we'll play with the toneAC library from Tim Eckel (of NewPing fame) to boost the volume of the small beeper (buzzer) running off that 3v coin cell. It was always going to be a bit of challenge to run off 4v anyway, especailly a CR2032 coin cell but the challenge was met quite nicely!

<p>Unfortunately, using standard, bare piezo buzzers didn't realise the voume I wanted (not even when mounted on a case) so Iretained the 3-volt passive buzzer.

So this little PCB plugs into anywhere a Nano normally fits. I used a standard DIP 328P as I had so many of them this was an ideal opportunity to use some of them. These days it's all SMD, no THT allowed!  
This is the slightly hacked board into which it plugs (Universal Timer)
